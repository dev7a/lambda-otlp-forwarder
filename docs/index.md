## TL;DR
{: .text-delta }

Tired of slow Lambda functions because of telemetry overhead? We've got you covered! ðŸš€

Lambda OTLP Forwarder makes sending OpenTelemetry data from your AWS Lambda functions super easy and efficient. Here's how it works:

1. Drop in our lightweight libraries for your favorite language (Rust, Python, or Node.js)
2. Add a few lines of instrumentation code
3. Let the magic happen - we'll capture your telemetry data from CloudWatch Logs and send it to your collector

That's it! No more dealing with slow extension layers or expensive direct connections. Your functions stay fast (just writing to stdout!) and your wallet stays happy. Plus, your architecture stays clean and simple.

Think of it as a smart pipeline that gets your telemetry data where it needs to go, without getting in your way. Pretty neat, right? ðŸ˜Š
